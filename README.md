# Express-MongoDB User Authentication System
This is my first backend project where I use MongoDB and Express to implement a user authentication system. It includes password hashing using bcrypt for enhanced security.

## Incoming Goals
- Implement user role management
- Create pages and use JWT to:
  - Display profiles for normal users
  - Manage users through an admin dashboard (e.g., delete, ban, update users)
- Add a password recovery process
- Enhance security measures (e.g., rate limiting, account lockout, spam)

### Frontend
For the frontend, I used React and Tailwindcss to create the layout and Axios to fetch data from the backend.
### Backend
For the backend, I used Express to handle server-side logic and routing. I used Mongoose to interact with the MongoDB database. For hashing passwords, I used bcrypt to ensure security.

## What I Learned
- __Create a backend__ using Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB to build a **API**.
- How to manage sensitive information with **.env** files, boosting my confidence in handling API keys securely. **This was a big learning experience. I was initially worried about uploading projects with sensitive information so  i was delete projects with sensitive information,** but now I feel confident managing it securely.
